# DSCI 554 Assignment 2: Bubble Cloud Infographic

## Description

### Dataset: United Nations Data

### Objective

In this assignment, your goal is to create an **infographic using bubble cloud charts** (not to be confused with bubble charts) to communicate information about various countries. You will achieve this by leveraging your design and data visualization skills to craft bubble cloud representations using an SVG editor and SVG code. The repository includes a `package.json` initialized with `npm init`.

## Tasks

1. **Data Collection**
   - Retrieve data for 10 countries from the United Nations data repository or API.
   - Download or fetch the necessary datasets in a suitable format for analysis (e.g., CSV, Excel, JSON).

2. **Design**
   - Utilize an SVG editor to craft a visually appealing bubble cloud infographic for the selected 10 countries.
   - Encode the data effectively to convey spatial information and data values within the infographic.

3. **Present Infographic on a Web page**
   - Create an HTML page that presents the infographic with information about the countries and the data.
   - Use the bubble cloud chart you designed in the SVG editor on the page.
   - Additionally, create a similar bubble cloud chart on the page using SVG code with different encodings and/or data (e.g., use color to convey spatial information instead of position).
   - Customize the page using the Bootstrap library.

## Submission

- Document your design choices comprehensively in the `README.md` using Markdown.
- Submit your bubble cloud infographic and charts within `index.html`.
- Organize your code with a CSS file, which you should reference in `index.html`.
- Present essential information and details regarding the dataset(s) you utilized on the page.
- Adhere to sound development practices: progress incrementally, test thoroughly, and commit your changes frequently.
- Use DevTools to ensure there are no errors.

## Rubric

|               | **Design** | **Implementation** |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| **Sophisticated** | Design choices are meticulously detailed in the README.md with proper Markdown formatting. Choices are well-reasoned and clearly explained, encompassing layout, chart form, and visual encodings for both the SVG chart created with an editor and the SVG code chart. Information presented is accompanied by explanatory text for enhanced comprehension (4-5 pts) | The visual display is exemplary, presenting information with clarity. The page is impeccably formatted using Bootstrap, without errors, and it successfully integrates the SVG chart created using an SVG editor and the SVG code chart, each with different design encodings (4-5 pts) |
| **Competent** | Design choices are presented in the README.md but may lack some detail or clarity (2-3 pts) | The implementation is functional but may have minor formatting issues, minor errors, or missing elements (2-3 pts) |
| **Needs work** | Design choices are either unclear or absent in the README.md (0-1 pts) | The implementation is incomplete or non-functional, containing significant errors (0-1 pts) |
